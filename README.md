# Yellow

This is Klauz, ur one and only.
I'm here to show u that:

1. anyone can make pull requests for ur public repository
2. that this is a pull request, and it's a nice way for devs to work

Why? because here u can review evry mytak i mak and suggest changes!
Once u do that i'll be pingated. and you will be waiting for my update.

As i correct the PR, u'll be notified, and once it's ready you can merge it and approve! Yay!
